# New Post-processing script
# 4/5/25 

# Later, turn into functions and work into main script

# Read in ML model predictions
# For a given dataname (i.e., "4_5_BL_12hr_FL_1dy")
# For all three trained models

# Smooth the predictions!!!
# 5-point Moving Average 

# Recalculate the evaluation statistics

# Create plot for entire test period
# Include evaluation statistics 

# Create plots for events
# Then I could REVERT THE main script to the old singular event version...
# THAT WOULD SOLVE the retraining issue...

# Some paneled figures?

# Some comparison figures, as before with the error statistics over each permutation
# Or just fix the one that is currently in main script

# Compare Basic, Stacked LSTM, and GRU and BL with same FL
